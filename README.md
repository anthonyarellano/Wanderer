# Wanderer
Wanderer is an AirBnb clone designed to be a conduit between home owners and renters, allowing travelers to book accomodations across the United States. After posting their listing, Hosts can edit all the details of their post barring the location. This design decision was to enforce the idea that a change of location warrants a separate listing. 

After booking a reservation logged in users can view their upcoming trips, get directions, and edit the details of their reservation within reason. These functionalities are enabled through a user interface designed for intuitive navigation and usability.
